WHAT?: The muse of my game I will try to create is Frogger.

HOW?: The game essentially is just trying to cross a busy road without getting hit and collect flags. Whoever gets 3 flags in the level wins. Unlimited lives, somewhat timed, and was couch CO-OP.

WHY?: My sister and I loved playing this when we were younger and is a main factor on why I still love gaming today!

Description: I will call my game "Animaul Crossing" because why not? (And yes it's spelt wrong for copyright reasons.) Will probably be single player.(Hopefully all works out well!)
